Blockchain-Based Voting System
This project implements a voting system using Ethereum blockchain technology. The goal is to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system that leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain.

**Features**
**Decentralized:** Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for decentralized storage and execution of voting processes.
**Security:** Transactions are secured using cryptographic principles inherent to blockchain.
**Transparency:** Voting data and results are transparent and auditable by anyone with access to the blockchain.
**Immutability:** Once recorded, votes cannot be altered or tampered with due to the blockchain's immutability.
**Accessibility:** Allows voters to securely cast their votes from anywhere using Ethereum wallets.

**Technologies Used**

**Ethereum:** Utilized for smart contract deployment and execution.
**Solidity:** Smart contracts are written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
**Web3.js:** JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
**Truffle:** Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.
